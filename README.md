Undergraduate Research Project done with Rajeeva Lokshanan under Dr. Nirav Bhatt, Dept. of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, IITM

Our project aims at qualitatively evaluating foundational genomic LLMs and characterizing their embeddings.
This repository contains the suite of tools I have developed so far, as metrics to evaluate these models, along with the relevant research papers.
